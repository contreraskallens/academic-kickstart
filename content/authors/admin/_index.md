Hey! I’m a Ph. D. Student at the Department of Psychology, Cornell University. I’m a member of the Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Cornell University and the Co-Mind Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles. My main research interests lie in the foundations of modern culturally-transformed human cognition, especially through symbol use, language and categorization. Having a background in Philosophy of Science, I’m also interested in data-driven exploration of scientific activity. I like to tackle these topics through a combination of theory-driven hypothesis formation and computational data analysis.
